Given the evaluation steps, return a JSON with two keys:
1) a `score` key ranging from 0 - 10, with 10 being that it follows the criteria outlined in the steps and 0 being that it does not.
2) a `reason` key, a reason for the given score. Please mention specific information from {{ parameters }} in your reason, but be very concise with it!

Evaluation Steps:
{{ evaluation_steps }}

{{ text }}

**
IMPORTANT: Please make sure to only return in JSON format, with the "score" and "reason" key. No words or explanation is needed.

Example JSON:
{
    "score": 0,
    "reason": "The text does not follow the evaluation steps provided."
}
